# Meson for Visual Studio Code

This extension provides support for [Meson](http://mesonbuild.com/) in
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This language grammar was
based on the grammar found in the
[atom extension](https://github.com/TingPing/language-meson) from
[Patrick Griffis](https://github.com/TingPing), but has since been added onto to
support more features, including code from the VSCode
[grammar](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/extensions/python/syntaxes/MagicPython.tmLanguage.json)
for Python.
